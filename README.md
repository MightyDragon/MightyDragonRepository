How to run the code:

The main class of our project is called, StartFile, if you run the project from there, the Pokemon project is going to be run. Go to the war folder and open dragon.html in a browser (preferably Safari). To run the Library, change line 59, in StartFile, from 0 to 1. To run our mock objects used for early stages of testing, change line 59 to 2, however, this won’t output a visual image since we didn’t create the objects instantiated file or the static method call hierarchy for our mock objects.
